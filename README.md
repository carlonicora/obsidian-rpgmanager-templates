## Contributing

Contributions via bug reports, bug fixes, documentation, and general improvements are always welcome. For more major
feature work, make an issue about the feature idea / reach out to me so we can judge feasibility and how best to
implement it.

## Support

Have you found the RpgManager plugin helpful, and want to support it? I accept donations which go towards future
development efforts. I generally do not accept payment for bug bounties/feature requests, as financial incentives add
stress/expectations which I want to avoid for a hobby project!
